# Sussudio.Tests Migration Plan

The test project runs a large legacy check catalog through a hand-rolled
`Program.cs` runner that loads `Sussudio.dll` via reflection. Cluster
`test-framework-migration` opens the dual-stack path: keep the legacy runner,
add xUnit alongside, and port incrementally.

## What's in place

- xUnit 2.9 + `xunit.runner.visualstudio` + `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk` referenced
  in `Sussudio.Tests.csproj`. `OutputType=Exe` stays so the legacy runner keeps
  working via `dotnet run`; `dotnet test` discovers `[Fact]`/`[Theory]` members.
- `[assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("Sussudio.Tests")]` on `Sussudio` and
  `tools/ssctl`. The seam is open even though tests still resolve types via
  reflection — see the targeting note below for why direct references stay
  off the table for now.
- `XUnit.RecordingContractsTests.cs` is the worked example — port pattern
  uses `Assembly.LoadFrom` against the staged `Sussudio.dll` (the legacy
  runner already does the same), and asserts via xUnit primitives instead
  of the hand-rolled `AssertContains/AssertEqual` helpers.
- `XUnit.BoolConvertersTests.cs` owns the former legacy bool/visibility
  converter checks.
- `XUnit.MediaFormatTests.cs` owns the former legacy MediaFormat equality and
  hash-code checks.
- `StatsOverlay.Lifecycle.Tests.cs` now owns xUnit source-contract checks for
  stats overlay lifecycle and section chrome wiring. The remaining stats
  presentation checks still migrate incrementally from the legacy catalog.
- `XUnit.StatsPresentation.Formatting.Tests.cs` owns the former legacy
  detached-window, encoder formatting, expected-display-repeat, and compact
  preview summary stats presentation behavior checks.
- `XUnit.StatsPresentation.FrameTime.Tests.cs` owns the former legacy frame-time
  range and frame-time geometry stats presentation behavior checks.
- `XUnit.StatsHardwareRowsTests.cs` owns the former legacy hardware decode/GPU
  row formatting behavior checks. `XUnit.StatsHardwareRows.InputProvider.Tests.cs`
  owns hardware-row input sampling policy checks.
- `XUnit.CapturePoliciesTests.cs` owns the former legacy HdrOutputPolicy
  behavior and HDR output environment-switch checks.
- `XUnit.RuntimeHelpersTests.cs` owns focused runtime helper behavior checks.
- `XUnit.SnapshotModelsTests.cs` owns the former legacy
  SourceSignalTelemetrySnapshot, SourceTelemetryDetailEntry, and source
  telemetry automation projection contract checks.
- `XUnit.SmallContractsTests.cs` owns the former legacy audio input, audio
  level event, capture device, and automation window action small contracts.
- `XUnit.CaptureConfigurationModelsTests.cs` owns shared reflection helpers for
  capture configuration xUnit contract checks.
- `XUnit.CaptureModeOptionsTests.cs` owns capture mode option display metadata
  and option-builder behavior checks.
- `XUnit.CaptureSettingsContractsTests.cs` owns capture settings defaults,
  output path/file naming, bitrate policy, and MJPEG HFR policy checks.
- `XUnit.RecordingConfigurationPolicyTests.cs` owns recording selection policy,
  encoder support, and recording pipeline option contract checks.
- `XUnit.FlashbackModelsTests.cs` owns the former legacy Flashback buffer,
  session, playback-state, export progress, export segment, and export request
  model contract checks.
- `XUnit.ToolFormatterContractsTests.cs` owns focused tool formatter contract
  checks.
- Additional focused `[Fact]`/`[Theory]` files such as
  `AutomationContracts.ProtocolXunit.Tests.cs`,
  `AutomationToolContracts.ProtocolXunit.Tests.cs`,
  `RuntimeContracts.Tests.cs`, `WindowSnapRegionLayoutPolicy.Tests.cs`,
  `CaptureService.HealthSnapshots.AssemblyAndSamplerOwnership.Tests.cs`,
  `CaptureService.HealthSnapshots.FlashbackOwnership.Tests.cs`, and
  `CaptureService.HealthSnapshots.RecordingAndSourceTelemetryOwnership.Tests.cs`
  already run through `dotnet test`.

## Targeting reality

The test project targets **net8.0** while `Sussudio.csproj` targets
**net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0**. Adding a `<ProjectReference>` from tests to
Sussudio would force a Windows target on the test rig and pull WinUI/Windows
SDK deps into VSTest discovery — that's a much larger change than the
xUnit migration warrants. Until Sussudio.Models/Sussudio.Services.Contracts
are extracted into a true `net8.0` (or netstandard) library, ported xUnit
tests will keep using `Assembly.LoadFrom` to resolve Sussudio types. The
`InternalsVisibleTo` seam still pays off because tests can call internal
APIs by reflection without `BindingFlags.NonPublic` gymnastics on private
backing fields.

## How to run

- Legacy runner:
  `dotnet exec tests\Sussudio.Tests\bin\Debug\net8.0\Sussudio.Tests.dll "<path-to-Sussudio.dll>"`
- xUnit cases:
  `dotnet test tests/Sussudio.Tests/Sussudio.Tests.csproj --no-restore`

Both must stay green during the migration.

## Migration order

Port in roughly this order, then retire the legacy `Program.cs` runner once
every check has a `[Fact]`/`[Theory]` equivalent:

1. **Pure-data Model tests** (`CaptureSettings`, `MediaFormat`,
   `RecordingFormat`, `SplitEncodeSupport`, etc.). Until the app-facing model
   types move into a neutral target, xUnit tests still resolve them from the
   staged `Sussudio.dll`; `InternalsVisibleTo` reduces private-member cracking
   but does not remove the assembly-loading boundary.
2. **Contracts tests** (`RecordingContext`, `FinalizeResult`,
   `GpuPipelineHandles`, `IRecordingSink` shape).
3. **Behavioral service tests** that exercise pure logic
   (`FrameLedger`, `RecordingPipelineOptions`, `PresentMonProbe`).
4. **Source-shape tests** - replace broad implementation-grep tests with
   behavioral tests where behavior is the contract. Keep focused ownership and
   source-shape assertions when the architecture boundary itself is the
   contract, and keep them small enough that a legitimate move has one obvious
   test update.
5. **Reflection-over-private tests** — rewrite to use the now-internal API
   directly. If a test still needs to peek at a private field, the design is
   probably the bug; consider exposing the value or restructuring.
6. **Integration tests** — stand up in-process flows via the
   `IProcessSupervisor` `DispatchProxy` seam already in
   `RecordingVerifier.Integration.Tests.cs`. Targets: HDR/SDR encode round-trip,
   flashback ring-buffer rotation, automation hub ssctl/MCP command surface.

## Conventions for ported tests

- Prefer a class per source-file-area. New migration-only owner files may use
  `XUnit.<Area>Tests.cs`; existing focused xUnit files can keep their area
  names when that is clearer than renaming churn.
- Use `Assert.Equal/True/False/Contains/Empty`. Avoid `Assert.Equal(expected,
  actual, comparer)` overloads unless the type genuinely needs custom equality.
- For HDR/P010 paths, prefer behavioural tests that drive the encoder against a
  small fixture buffer. Source-grep contract assertions stay only when the
  public API shape is the contract.
- Don't touch the legacy `Program.cs` runner: keep both stacks green until the
  port is complete.

## Open work tracked separately

- `source_text_grep_assertions_couple_to_text` — replace per-area, biggest win.
- `structural_snapshot_tests_dont_verify_behavior` — collapse property-name
  loops into behavioural tests.
- `untested_critical_subsystems_on_hdr_rail` — needs the integration-test seam
  before meaningful coverage lands.
