# Sussudio Defragmentation Baseline

This file should be filled or regenerated before the next architecture slice. It exists so the active goal can measure defragmentation against concrete data instead of vibes.

Run from the repository root:

```powershell
./scripts/architecture/Capture-SussudioDefragBaseline.ps1
```

That script writes `docs/architecture/Sussudio-Defragmentation-Baseline.generated.md`.

## Values to capture

- Total production `.cs` files.
- Total test `.cs` files.
- Percentage of production `.cs` files under 60 lines.
- Percentage of production `.cs` files under 80 lines.
- Largest partial-type clusters by file count.
- Largest implementation files by line count.
- Areas where a normal feature/bug review requires more than about five primary production files.

## Known reported symptoms to verify

- `AutomationDiagnosticsHub`: approximately 217 files.
- `CaptureService`: approximately 109 files.
- `MainWindow`: approximately 95 files.
- `MainViewModel`: approximately 66 files.
- Approximately 44% of all `.cs` files are under 60 lines.

## Slice Evidence

Date: 2026-05-21
Area: Tool snapshot formatting
Problem: Thread-health formatter rows were scattered across one section-order file plus three one-row partial files in both the shared `AutomationSnapshotFormatter` and ssctl `Formatters` implementations.
Files consolidated: `tools/Common/AutomationSnapshotFormatter.ThreadHealth.*.cs`; `tools/ssctl/Formatters.Snapshot.ThreadHealth.*.cs`
Files added: none
Net production .cs delta: -6
Partial clusters reduced: `AutomationSnapshotFormatter` -3 files; `Formatters` -3 files
Build/tests/runtime checks: `dotnet build Sussudio.slnx -p:Platform=x64 --no-restore`; `dotnet test tests\Sussudio.Tests\Sussudio.Tests.csproj --no-restore`; offline runtime snapshot harness; `git diff --check`
CLI/MCP/pipe checks, if applicable: covered by ssctl formatter contracts and runtime snapshot formatter tests
Behavior preserved: formatter output paths and section order remain unchanged; only source ownership changed
Notes for future agents: keep formatter row families grouped when they are one visible section; split again only for a named formatter collaborator or a demonstrable testability boundary
