# Sussudio Defragmentation Baseline

This file should be filled or regenerated before the next architecture slice. It exists so the active goal can measure defragmentation against concrete data instead of vibes.

Run from the repository root:

```powershell
./scripts/architecture/Capture-SussudioDefragBaseline.ps1
```

That script writes `docs/architecture/Sussudio-Defragmentation-Baseline.generated.md`.

## Values to capture

- Total production `.cs` files.
- Total test `.cs` files.
- Percentage of production `.cs` files under 60 lines.
- Percentage of production `.cs` files under 80 lines.
- Largest partial-type clusters by file count.
- Largest implementation files by line count.
- Areas where a normal feature/bug review requires more than about five primary production files.

## Known reported symptoms to verify

- `AutomationDiagnosticsHub`: approximately 217 files.
- `CaptureService`: approximately 109 files.
- `MainWindow`: approximately 95 files.
- `MainViewModel`: approximately 66 files.
- Approximately 44% of all `.cs` files are under 60 lines.

## Slice Evidence

Date: 2026-05-21
Area: Tool snapshot formatting
Problem: Thread-health formatter rows were scattered across one section-order file plus three one-row partial files in both the shared `AutomationSnapshotFormatter` and ssctl `Formatters` implementations.
Files consolidated: `tools/Common/AutomationSnapshotFormatter.ThreadHealth.*.cs`; `tools/ssctl/Formatters.Snapshot.ThreadHealth.*.cs`
Files added: none
Net production .cs delta: -6
Partial clusters reduced: `AutomationSnapshotFormatter` -3 files; `Formatters` -3 files
Build/tests/runtime checks: `dotnet build Sussudio.slnx -p:Platform=x64 --no-restore`; `dotnet test tests\Sussudio.Tests\Sussudio.Tests.csproj --no-restore`; offline runtime snapshot harness; `git diff --check`
CLI/MCP/pipe checks, if applicable: covered by ssctl formatter contracts and runtime snapshot formatter tests
Behavior preserved: formatter output paths and section order remain unchanged; only source ownership changed
Notes for future agents: keep formatter row families grouped when they are one visible section; split again only for a named formatter collaborator or a demonstrable testability boundary

Date: 2026-05-21
Area: Tool snapshot formatting
Problem: Flashback encoding subsection routing lived in one-method shared and ssctl partial files separate from the Flashback section owner.
Files consolidated: `tools/Common/AutomationSnapshotFormatter.Flashback.Encoding.cs`; `tools/ssctl/Formatters.Snapshot.Flashback.Encoding.cs`
Files added: none
Net production .cs delta: -2
Partial clusters reduced: `AutomationSnapshotFormatter` -1 file; `Formatters` -1 file
Build/tests/runtime checks: `dotnet build Sussudio.slnx -p:Platform=x64 --no-restore`; `dotnet test tests\Sussudio.Tests\Sussudio.Tests.csproj --no-restore`; offline runtime snapshot harness; `git diff --check`
CLI/MCP/pipe checks, if applicable: covered by ssctl/shared formatter contract tests
Behavior preserved: Flashback formatter gating, section order, encoding status, and encoding health output stay unchanged
Notes for future agents: keep one-method subsection routers with their section owner unless the router grows real policy

Date: 2026-05-21
Area: Tool snapshot formatting
Problem: Automation response-success detection lived in a one-method partial file separate from the other JSON value accessors.
Files consolidated: `tools/Common/AutomationSnapshotFormatter.Response.cs`

CLI/MCP/pipe checks, if applicable: covered by shared formatter contracts and MCP/ssctl tool formatter tests
Behavior preserved: `AutomationSnapshotFormatter.IsSuccess` signature and semantics stay unchanged
Notes for future agents: keep generic JSON response/value helpers together unless response handling becomes a named policy object

Date: 2026-05-21
Area: Diagnostic session result formatting
Problem: Three small diagnostic-session summary rows lived in separate partial files from the formatter orchestration, forcing a reader to open four files to understand the top-level report flow.

CLI/MCP/pipe checks, if applicable: covered by diagnostic-session formatter ownership tests and runtime formatter tests
Behavior preserved: diagnostic-session report order and row text remain unchanged
Notes for future agents: keep short scalar summary rows with the formatter root unless they grow separate formatting policy

Date: 2026-05-21
Area: Diagnostic session result models
Problem: Preview cadence and visual-cadence DTO fields were split across two tiny partial files even though callers treat them as one preview cadence result surface.
Files consolidated: `tools/Common/DiagnosticSessionResult.PreviewVisualCadence.cs`
Files added: none
Net production .cs delta: -1
Partial clusters reduced: `DiagnosticSessionResult` -1 file
Build/tests/runtime checks: `dotnet build Sussudio.slnx -p:Platform=x64 --no-restore`; `dotnet test tests\Sussudio.Tests\Sussudio.Tests.csproj --no-restore`; offline runtime snapshot harness; `git diff --check`
CLI/MCP/pipe checks, if applicable: covered by diagnostic-session model ownership and formatter tests
Behavior preserved: DTO property names and init semantics stay unchanged
Notes for future agents: keep preview cadence DTO fields grouped unless visual cadence grows independent behavior or a separate model type

Date: 2026-05-21
Area: Diagnostic session result models
Problem: Flashback playback result fields kept 1% low and audio-master performance properties in separate tiny DTO partials from the cadence/frame-delivery properties that consume the same playback performance projection.
